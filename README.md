# BlockchainChallenge
A short challenge to anyone willing to attempt it.

## Build a minimal but complete blockchain
This challenge is pretty straightforward. Build a minimal blockchain to learn the basics of this technology. Fork this repository to accept the challenge and implement a blockchain in whatever language you choose. The challenge is real, but the points don't matter. For this challenge, a minimal blockchain should include:

1 - Input method for transactions. These ledger entries can be whatever you want, to do list, accounting transactions, video game results ledger, whatever you want. Input can be a web page, a rest endpoint (tested with postman) or anything else you come up with. Bonus points if you enforce some consensus rules on individual entries.

2 - Blocks are mined using a basic proof of work algorithm (you'll need to research how this works, but it's pretty straightforward). Bonus points if you allow multiple entries in a block.

3 - Provide some kind of block explorer to see the results of your creation.

 * Whatever language you choose. Recommended languages are Go, C/C++, Java, Python or Rust

## Why would you take up this challenge?

Because everyone and their dog has been becoming a "blockchain expert" and you want to prove how easy it is/how hard it is!

# Good luck! :)
